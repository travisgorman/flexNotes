# Flex Ordering

By default, the `order` property of all flex items is 0. Items are arranged along the main axis by order, so by giving `.box7` an order property of 1, it pops out of order and moves to the end of the main axis. 

By giving `.box3` a n `order` value of 2, it moves to the right of `.box7`.
